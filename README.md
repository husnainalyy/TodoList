# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Todo List Application

This is a Todo List application built with React and Framer Motion for animations.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Smooth animations for task addition, completion, and deletion

## File Structure

The main component of the application is `TodoPage.jsx`. This component is responsible for rendering the Todo List. It uses a React ref to create a reference to a DOM element, which is then used to apply animations. The `allTodo` array contains all the tasks, and each task is rendered as a separate component. Framer Motion is used to apply animations to these components.

## Usage

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/husnainalyy/TodoList.git
